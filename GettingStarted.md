Click on the `source` tab and then `checkout`. Follow the instructions to clone the repository.

# learning ptempest #
The best way to learn how to use ptempest is by example. Browse to the `examples` folder. The negative-feedback oscillator, `nfo`, is the best place to start. Begin by reading the `README` file. Then take a look at the configuration script, `config.m`. The `run_pt.m` script shows you how to start a parallel tempering estimation job in Matlab.
